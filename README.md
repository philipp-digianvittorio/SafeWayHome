# SafeWayHome
## Outline
- scrape incidents from presseportal.de, categorize incidents (train on one city, demonstrate for another one)
- map incidents on open street view map
- set up map with green/yellow/red areas according to safety issues
- include parks/underpasses/industrial areas
- (extension: reporting feature "I felt unsafe here")

## Open Questions/Issues
- classification: 
  - incidents that fall into more than one category
  - no street name/only street number
  - "Vort√§uschen einer Straftat" - extra category or dismiss?
- interface:
  - pins with incidents: over Street names or coordinates?
  - dropdown with 2 cities (coordinates would be fixed)
